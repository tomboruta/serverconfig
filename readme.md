## Server Config

[Server Config](http://serverconfig.io/) is a project to help web developers use sensible server settings for web technologies. 

### Contributing

Given all the various web technologies and nuances in those technologies I have added this project to Github in the hopes to get the best info and the best settings for each technology. 

Although this uses the Laravel Framework, you can fork and use with no knowledge of Laravel by following the steps below

1. Clone the repo to your local machine
2. Setup MAMP/WAMP/other to point to the /public folder
3. Make sure /app/storage is writable by your webserver (you may not have to do anything)

(no database is needed at this point)

That's it.

The HTML of the site is in /resources/views

All the data and functionality is in /public/js/serverConfig.js

Issues and Pull Requests are always welcome.
